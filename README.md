This is a collection of my dotfiles, written in Nix. This is a flake, so you can easily borrow packages from here if so desired.

### Packages

Because this is a Nix Flake, you can easily try out some of the packages I use.

##### Julia with pre-compiled sysimage for common packages

```
nix shell github:aaronjanse/dotfiles#julia
```
